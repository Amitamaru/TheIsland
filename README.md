# TheIsland
Java core project "Dynamic Island"


Heelo every one.
This is study project "th Island" where main them were using OOP and Multithreading. 
In this program u can use yaml setting files to configure island resolution, period to show statistic on the island and start delay
On the island a lot of organisms like carnivorous and herbivorous and some plants. Animals can move? eat and multiply with their setting.

Grafics and statistics are simple and just show only icon and how many current type of organism in cell. 
After every print of island it print total organism are left on the island.

P.S. Hope it works fine =/
